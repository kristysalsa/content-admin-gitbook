* **Content type:** Select a content type to only display that type of content.
* **Published status:** Select the publishing status to show only published or only unpublished content.
* **Language:** Select from the dropdown list to display only content in a specific language.

Once you’ve made your selections \(you can use one or all of the filters above\) click **Filter**.
