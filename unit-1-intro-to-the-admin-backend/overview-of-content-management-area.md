# Overview of content management area

Below the Admin menu, the page title shows that you’re in the Content area of the admin interface.

Underneath that you have three navigation options in the form of tabs:

1. Content
2. Files
3. Media

Click on the Files tab to see the list of files on your site, and click on the Media tab to view a list of the media you’ve uploaded into your GovCMS site. Unit 6 looks at managing media files and assets in GovCMS in more detail.

Below the tabs is a breadcrumb link that shows you’re in the Home//Administration section of the site, and underneath that the **Add content** button.

**Tip:** The breadcrumb provides a handy “Home” link, which takes you to the homepage of your site. It’s a fast way to switch from the admin _backend_ to the _frontend_.

Next is the ability to filter the list of content displayed, and access to bulk operations \(we’ll look at both of these features next\).

Then, we have the list of actual site content, displayed by default in date order, with the most recent content at the top.
