# Contributing and Feedback 

Firstly, thanks for taking the time to contribute to the training manuals. Your contribution, whether it's to provide feedback or help to contribute to making these manuals better, is appreciated. 

The following provides some information on how to contribute and where to find issues on the roadmap. These are mostly guidelines and feedback on these guidelines are welcomed as well. So feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request. 

## Overview

Originally the content administation manual was a Word/PDF document, and what you can see here is the iterated version of this manual, converted into markdown format and separated in to smaller sections. While it is hosted on Github, it is synced with Gitbook which is accessible via a public facing URL, which you can find here: https://salsa-digital.gitbook.io/govcms-content-administration 

The [govcms-training](https://github.com/govcms-training) distribution currently entails both the [content administation manual](https://github.com/govcms-training/content-admin) and the [site builder manual](https://github.com/govcms-training/content-admin). These share a [public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/govcms-training/projects/1) which lists out current issues on a kanban board with some future ideas for improving them. 

Before submitting an issue, please have a look at either the Roadmap or the [current issue queue](https://github.com/govcms-training/content-admin/issues) to ensure your issue or suggestion has not already been raised.
