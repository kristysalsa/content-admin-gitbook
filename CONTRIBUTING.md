# Contributing and Feedback 

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the training manuals! Weâ€™re continually working on improving these documents with community input and we appreciate any feedback, whether it's helping to contribute to further documentation or code, grammar issues, or simply a suggestion or improvement.

## Providing feedback

## Overview

Originally, the content administation manual was a Word/PDF document and what you can see here is the iterated version of this manual; converted into markdown format and separated in to smaller sections. While it is hosted on Github, it is synced with Gitbook, which is accessible via the following public facing URL: https://salsa-digital.gitbook.io/govcms-content-administration 


The [govcms-training](https://github.com/govcms-training) distribution currently entails both the [content administation manual](https://github.com/govcms-training/content-admin) and the [site builder manual](https://github.com/govcms-training/content-admin). These share a [public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/govcms-training/projects/1) which lists out the issues for both repos on a kanban board with some future ideas for improvement.
