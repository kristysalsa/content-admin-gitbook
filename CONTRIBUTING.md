# Contributing and Feedback 

Firstly, thanks for taking the time to contribute to the training manuals! Your contribution, whether it's to provide feedback or help to contribute to making these manuals better, is appreciated. 

The following provides some information on how to contribute and where to find issues on the roadmap. These are mostly guidelines, and any feedback you may have on this document is welcomed. 

## Overview

Originally, the content administation manual was a Word/PDF document, and what you can see here is the iterated version of this manual, converted into markdown format and separated in to smaller sections. While it is hosted on Github, it is synced with Gitbook, which is accessible via the following public facing URL: https://salsa-digital.gitbook.io/govcms-content-administration 

The [govcms-training](https://github.com/govcms-training) distribution currently entails both the [content administation manual](https://github.com/govcms-training/content-admin) and the [site builder manual](https://github.com/govcms-training/content-admin). These share a [public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/govcms-training/projects/1) which lists out current issues on a kanban board with some future ideas for improvement. 

Before submitting an issue, please have a look at either the Roadmap or the [current issue queue](https://github.com/govcms-training/content-admin/issues) to ensure your issue or suggestion has not already been raised. 


## Providing feedback 

There are a few ways you can provide feedback: 

* You can submit an issue via the GitHub issue queue here: https://github.com/govcms-training/content-admin/issues
* You can email your feedback govcms.training@salsadigital.com.au 
* If you'd like to contribute and make changes, please see the [Contributing via Github]() method below.  


## Contributing via Github

This repo has two main branches and uses the [`git flow`](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) workflow:

* `develop`: the default branch to be used for development


The [public link on Gitbook](https://salsa-digital.gitbook.io/govcms-content-administration/) is synced with the `master` branch. Any changes  should be forked via the the `develop` branch.
