# Inserting media files

You can insert images and video directly into the body field via the Media widget. Click on the _Media Entity Embed_ button to open the Media widget. ![](../.gitbook/assets/32.png)

You can upload a file from your computer using the Upload tab. Click on the **Upload** tab, then the **Browse** button. Select the file and then click **Open**. Next, add metadata for the file you’ve uploaded. For more information on the metadata, please see Unit 6: Managing files and media assets in GovCMS. ![](../.gitbook/assets/33%20%282%29.png)

Using the Media widget you can also use the Embed code function \(e.g. for YouTube videos\).

All files uploaded or included from a website will be added to your Media Library. Media assets that have been uploaded are displayed with the most recent one first. You can also search/filter media files using the top field/dropdown.

You can select a media file from the Media Library and then click the **Place** button at the bottom of the page to add the media.

**Note:** _When you use a file from the Media Library or Files area, you’re linking to a copy of the file, including its metadata. If you make changes to the file or its metadata, these changes will take effect for every use of the file._

When an image is added into a Rich Text field, the image will be added in its original size. You can change the image size within the CMS/Rich Text editor by double-clicking on the image in the Rich Text editor and selecting **Thumbnail** from the “Display as” dropdown. You can then choose a predefined _Image Style_ that will be applied to the image to adjust its size.

You can also choose to align the image to the left, centre or right, and include a caption.
