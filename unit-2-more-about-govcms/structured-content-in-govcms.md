# Structured content in GovCMS

Fields allow for the presentation of website content to the end user in a variety of displays. Using fields in GovCMS allows Content Editors to add content once and then the CMS will reuse it across the site in a variety of displays. Using fields to capture and display data \(structured content\), takes away the inconvenience of managing the same content in different areas of the website.

In the example above the website is configured to display the “GovCMS Information session”, \(which is an Event content type\) in two different displays - a “Teaser display” \(used in listings\) and the “Full Page display”. It shows the same event, but the information presented to the public differs based on the website configuration.

Similarly, a Job listing search may reveal summary information about the advertised job, as displayed below:

Clicking the job title brings the viewer to the full page with more details about the particular job listing. This is, in fact, the same content page but the CMS is just managing the way it displays this content to the end user.

The information is captured via the content editing form, and GovCMS will display it in the way preconfigured by the site builder \(the web development partner that built your website\). Content Editors don’t usually have much flexibility in changing the layout of the page \(or a display, such as the search page display\). However, the use of advanced tools - like Panelizer and Paragraphs - allows some advanced control to the page layout and provides additional display options depending on your GovCMS website configuration.

Media assets \(such as images or PDF files\) are also reused and presented to the viewer in a variety of ways. For example, an image that was uploaded as part of content creation gets stored in the central media library. That image can be referenced from other pages, and GovCMS will create a copy of the image in line with the preconfigured image dimensions.
