# Overview of content create/edit form

When creating or editing content in GovCMS, you’ll use the content form. While each content type might have some custom areas, there are also many sections common to all content creation forms. We’ll use the Standard page form to highlight these areas.

The main areas are:

2. **Thumbnail and featured image:** Select images for thumbnail view or to be displayed in the page.
3. **Body:** Type \(or copy and paste\) the text for the body content.
4. **Attachments:** Select any files you’d like to attach to the page.
5. **Full content:** Type of content display required.
6. **Components:** Add Components to the page \(Components are discussed in unit 12 of this manual\)
7. **Save as:** Save as Draft, Needs review, or Published.
8. **Save and Preview** buttons.
