# Creating Content

You can create content one of two ways:

1. Click on **Content** from the Admin bar and then click on the **Add content** button.
2. Hover your mouse over content, then hover over **Add content**, then click on the type of content you’d like to create.

#### Exercise 3.1: Create some content

In this exercise you’ll learn how to create content, specifically a new Standard Page.

1. Go to the _Content_ overview page and click **Add content**
2. Select the **Standard page** link from the list of content types. The standard page is one of the simplest types of content.
3. Add some text to the Title and Body fields \(for the moment, ignore the other fields such as Thumbnail, Attachments, etc.\)
4. At the bottom of the form, select _Save as:_ “Needs review”
5. Click **Save.** You’ll automatically be taken to the page as it will appear on the frontend of your website.
6. Make a note of the URL

Once you've saved the new content, you’ll notice the following GovCMS features:

1. The title of the new page is part of the page’s URL. We look at this feature more in Unit 7.
2. You can see a status message, which is only visible to you. This message disappears if you refresh the page.
3. You can see the additional tools of Edit, Manage display, and Delete. These are only visible because you’re logged in \(they cannot be seen by the public\).
4. The new content isn’t live/published and won’t be until it goes through a publishing workflow. This means that if you log out you won’t be able to see the content.

If you go back to the _Content_ administration area, you’ll see your new content in the content listing. In the _Content Type_ column, it should indicate that your page is a Standard page.
