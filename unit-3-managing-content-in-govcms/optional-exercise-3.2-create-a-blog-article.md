#### Optional Exercise 3.2: Create a Blog Article

Let’s practice creating some content, editing fields, and using the markup toolbar. In this exercise you will create a blog article and see how the automated listing of content will display it.

1. In the NavBar, go to Content
2. Click **Add content**
3. Click **Blog article**
4. Add a title
5. In the "Categories" field, select some taxonomy terms \(those allow us to categorise content and make searching for it easier - we will explore GovCMS’s taxonomy system later\). The field for Categories is called “autocomplete text”. As you begin typing any text in the field, GovCMS will try to match an existing category and display it below the field. Use your mouse to select the perfect match. New Categories can be created by entering a unique text.
6. Use the **Add another item** button to add multiple taxonomy terms. Try to enter something unique, not yet present in your site.
7. Select an image to use for the Thumbnail and Featured image. Search through and select existing media.
8. In the Body field, add some formatted text, including bold text, italics, a link and a bullet-point list
9. Set the content to Needs Review.
10. Click **Save**
11. Edit the page again and publish it.

Go to the Blog page and see if your Blog article appears in the list of items.
