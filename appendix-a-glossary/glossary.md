      <td style="text-align:left">Plain text format means text contains no formatting such as bold/italics,
        coloured fonts, different font styles, etc. Rich text format allows text
        to be formatted with colours applied, etc. In a CMS if you have plain text
        only, using HTML tags would not format the text. For example, if you entered
        &lt;b&gt;Bold&lt;/b&gt; that&#x2019;s exactly what would be displayed on
        your site. But if you&#x2019;re using a Rich Text editor, it would pick
        up the HTML tags and <b>Bold</b> would be displayed on your site.</td>

      <td style="text-align:left">Theme</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">A theme is a GovCMS/Drupal extension that changes the way a website looks
        (and sometimes changes functionality). The default GovCMS theme has been

        themes.</td>

          of your choice. E.g. /at/this/address</p>
        <p>An <b>automated alias</b> is generated automatically and is based on predefined
          URL pathways. For example, it might include:</p>
        <p>content-type/year/title and so the content might have the URL:</p>
        <p><b>/news/2019/Minister-announces-data-funding</b>
