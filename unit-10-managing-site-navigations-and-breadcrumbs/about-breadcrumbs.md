# About breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs show the hierarchy path of a website and are a quick and easy way for users to get back to certain pages. For example, if a user is on a specific media release titled ‘GovCMS reaches 300 sites’, the breadcrumb may display this:

Home &gt; Media releases &gt; GovCMS reaches 300 sites

A user can then click on Home or on Media releases to navigate to those two pages.

The exact breadcrumb will depend on your site’s structure and the number of levels. A breadcrumb is particularly useful for larger sites. Take this example:

Home &gt; Publications &gt; Media releases &gt; 2019 &gt; July &gt; Media release title

Using this breadcrumb, users can navigate quickly to Home, to the top level Publications page, to Media releases or even specifically to all 2019 media releases or all July 2019 media releases.
