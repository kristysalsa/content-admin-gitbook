# About site navigation

There are several different types of site navigation available on GovCMS websites. You can create menu items within the main header, in the sidebar and in the footer. You can also set up dropdown navigation so the menu items drop down when your mouse is on them. Other types of navigation include:

* A sitemap
* Breadcrumbs
* Sidebar ‘blocks’ with links to sub-pages
* ‘Go back to’ links that take the user back to the parent page in the navigation hierarchy

The GovCMS demo website features only one level of navigation/menu structure. However, GovCMS allows for up to nine levels within the menu system.

**Note**: Web best practice suggests no more than three levels of navigation should be used if possible.
