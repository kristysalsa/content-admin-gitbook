# Managing URL aliases and redirects

A URL \(Uniform Resource Locator\) is a web address. While some can be long and meaningless, others can be simple and descriptive. In this unit weâ€™ll look at redirects and aliases.

URLs can be automatically generated based on the page title, automatically generated numerically, or you can specify a URL for the page.
